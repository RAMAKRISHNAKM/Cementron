# **App Name**: CemOptAI

## Core Features:

- Real-time Data Ingestion: Ingest real-time data from plant sensors for various parameters of cement manufacturing.
- Raw Material Variability Prediction: Leverage AI tool to predict variability in raw material feed using ingested sensor data, and suggest adjustments for grinding efficiency to minimize energy losses.
- Clinkerization Parameter Optimization: Monitor high-temperature clinkerization operations and use AI to continuously adjust controls, aiming to lower energy demand and reduce environmental impact.
- Quality Consistency Assurance: Apply generative AI to detect fluctuations in input data and provide proactive corrections to maintain consistent product quality.
- Alternative Fuel Maximization: Create models for diverse fuel combinations to optimize thermal substitution rates and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, enhanced by AI-driven insights.
- Cross-Process Optimization: Integrate data from siloed streams (raw material to clinker to utilities) into a unified platform with AI making holistic decisions across the entire cement plant operation.
- Energy Consumption Prediction: The system must have Plant Utilities & Material Handling with capability to Predict and minimize energy consumption in utilities and optimize internal logistics flows.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Steel Blue (#4682B4) to represent the industrial nature of cement manufacturing, but also suggest stability and trustworthiness.
- Background color: Light Gray (#D3D3D3), a desaturated version of steel blue, provides a neutral backdrop that won't distract from critical data visualizations.
- Accent color: Gold (#FFD700) for highlighting key performance indicators (KPIs) and actionable insights, symbolizing efficiency and value.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, for a modern, machined, objective, neutral look suitable for a professional dashboard.
